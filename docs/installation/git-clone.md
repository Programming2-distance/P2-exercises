# Downloading the Exercises

On your computer, create a directory where you want to store Programming 2 related material.

> Do _not_ place this directory under OneDrive/DropBox/Google Drive.
> We will be working with GitHub, which is a better alternative for storing code in the cloud.
> Storing a Git repository on OneDrive/... could corrupt it.

Open a terminal in this directory.
Enter the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/UCLL-PR2/exercises
```

All exercises have now been downloaded in a subdirectory named `exercises`.
